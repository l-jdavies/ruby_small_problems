What will each block of code below print to the screen? Write your answer on a piece of paper or in a text editor and then run each block of code to see if you were correct.

### 1.
```
'4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")
```
Will print FALSE to the terminal. The string '4' is not the same as the integer 4.

### 2.
```
x = 2
   
if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
  puts "Did you get it right?"
else
  puts "Did you?"
end
```

Will print 'Did you get it right?' to the terminal because:

(2 * 3) / 2 = 6
4 + 4 - 2 - 3 =6
Therefore the expression will return `true` and the code following that expression will be executed. 

### 3.
```
y = 9
x = 10
if (x + 1) <= (y)
  puts "Alright."
elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
  puts "Alright now!"
elsif (y + 1) == x
  puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
else
  puts "Alrighty!"
end
```
Will print 'Alright now!' to the terminal because (x + 1) = 10, which is more than y = 9.
