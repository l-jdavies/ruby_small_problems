What does each method return in the following example?

```
arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)

2. arr.index[5]

3. arr[5]
```

1. Calling the method `index` on `arr` with the argument `5` will return the index of the object. In this case the object `5` has an index of 3.

2. Produce an error message - `index` method doesn't take an argument in square brackets.

3. `[5]` will return the object at index 5 in `arr`, which is 8.
