3. Using some of Ruby's built-in Hash methods, write a program that loops through a hash and prints all of the keys. Then write a program that does the same thing except printing the values. Finally, write a program that prints both.


```
name_and_age = { "Bob" => 42, "Steve" => 31, "Joe" => 19}

name_and_age.each_key { |k| puts k}
name_and_age.each_value { |v| puts v}
name_and_age.each_pair { |k, v| puts "#{k} is #{v} old!"}
```
