6. Given the following code...
```
x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
```
What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

I got this one wrong - I thought the two hashes were created with different versions of Ruby (my_hash2 with Ruby <1.9) but the correct answer is:

The first hash that was created used a symbol x as the key. The second hash used the string value of the x variable as the key.
