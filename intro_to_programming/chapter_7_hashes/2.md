2. Look at Ruby's merge method. Notice that it has two versions. What is the difference between merge and merge!? Write a program that uses both and illustrate the differences.

Difference is `merge!` mutates the caller but `merge` does not.

```
hash_one = {cat: "iggy", dog: "poppy"}
hash_two = {bob: 42, bill: 57}

puts hash_one.merge(hash_two)
puts hash_one
puts hash_one.merge!(hash_two)
puts hash_one
```
