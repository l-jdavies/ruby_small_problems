2. What will the following program print to the screen? What will it return?

```
def execute(&block)
  block
end

 execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }
 ```

 It returns a Proc object but nothing prints to the screen. Checked the solution - this is because the block wasn't activated with `block.call`
